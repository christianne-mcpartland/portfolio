<h1>Isometric Illustration</h1>

<p>This is a corky illustration piece that I created in the isometric style. I wanted there to be a good visual story. This piece was first conceptually created on pencil and paper, then rendered on Adobe Illustrator. I had a lot of fun through the whole process. </p>
