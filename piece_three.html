<h1>Organized Chaos</h1>

<p>For this illustration I was to find an artist that I would emulate the style of. The artist I chose was Glen Ronald, which is an artist based in Edmonton Alberta. He calls himself the chaos whisperer, and in his artwork there is intricate details that make the piece look chaotic.
For my illustration I chose to draw a modelâ€™s face, then to add the chaos, I decided to distort the hair. This piece was created using graphite pencil, a soft brushed black marker, and water colour.
