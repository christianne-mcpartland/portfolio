<h1>Laundry Time App</h1>

<p>This app was created in using the UI kit for android phones. The goal of the app was to solve the common problems that people have when doing their laundry. There are three functions to this prototyped app: laundry timer, symbol decoder, and what to use to get out those pesky stains. The timing function gives the user a 5-minute notification so that you have time to prep the machines for the next load to go in. The app is straight forward and the user can navigate with ease.
