<h1>Wild Oat Branding</h1>

<p>Wild Oat is a local Ottawa bakery and café that offers a wide variety of savoury and sweet food options. The café offers a lot of vegan and vegetarian options as well, and everything is made in their kitchen giving them a rustic and unique appeal.</p>

<p>This logo is a rebrand of the original logo Wild Oat currently has. The goal when creating this logo was to exemplify their rustic appeal, and show the atmosphere of their café by having the imagery of a peace sign. I wanted to incorporate in the piece sign the <em>W</em> and the <em>O</em> of Wild Oat. The brown tones were chosen to give that earthy feel across their brand.</p>
