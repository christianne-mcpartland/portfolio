<h1>Magazine Layout</h1>

<p>The objective of this project was to create an editorial design for an article that was a minimum of 4000 words, without any single spread being strictly body copy. This layout design was executed on InDesign. The article was on the topic of the Cecil Hotel where one of the guests started losing their minds. By the end of the article you find out that the guest had disappeared for multiple days, and her body was found in an unusual place.  I emulated that haunting feeling through imagery and typography. </p>
