<h1>Wild Life cross app</h1>

<p>Steam Whistle is a well-known brand that has a premium pilsner. I wanted to create a t-shirt that had a corky playful design, but also highlighted the fact that Steam Whistle provides its consumers with a premium pilsner. I used only the companies brand colours in the illustration. This was all created on illustrator. </p>
