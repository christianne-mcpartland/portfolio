<h1>Vesper Music Management Branding</h1>

<p>The goal when creating this logo was to emulate the style of art deco, and to incorporate the image of a vesper glass. This company manages up and coming artists, and so I came up with a logo that demonstrated those two elements, but still has a modern and clean look. The client wanted the logo to have the letters M and V present, and so I incorporated them into the glass using only straight lines to give it that modern edge.</p>
