<h1>Beardsley Illustration</h1>

<p>This illustration was inspired by the style of Aubrey Beardsley and considered to be <em>Art Nouveau</em>. The goal was to demonstrate in the illustration a debauchery, and the one I chose was alcoholism. This piece was originally drawn out in black marker and pen, then it was scanned in to illustrator, and traced to be a digital design. </p>
